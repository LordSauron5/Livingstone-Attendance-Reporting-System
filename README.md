# Livingstone-Attendance-Reporting-System
An information system (To be completed by 16 October 2020). Team Project.

·         Livingstone Attendance Reporting System was developed by a team of 5 members, of which I was the project leader.

·         This project is aimed at developing an information system to aid administration staff of Livingstone High School with manual paper-based work, specifically late-coming/student disciplinary logs.

·         The web-based management information system allows teachers to digitally capture the attendance of their students, and update the arrival time should students arrive late.

·         I managed the logical and physical construction of the system. Functions developed by me include class management (Creating, Updating, Deleting, Viewing) as well as student transference from one class to another. The login system I created required a valid email address and password to exist in the database, before granting access to the requesting user.  

·         This system was developed using vanilla PHP and JavaScript. Additionally, we used the MDBootstrap Library for JQuery and CSS
